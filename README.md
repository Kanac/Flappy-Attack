# Flappy-Bird
A Web App that will first reverse engineer Flappy Bird then add in my own features and skins to ultimately port this app to all popular mobile platforms using Apache Cordova soon

The work in progress can be viewed at http://kanac.github.io/Flappy-Bird/

The original project that I used to learn Javascript as well as the Phaser engine can be found at http://www.lessmilk.com/flappy_bird/01/. Using this tutorial as a scaffold, I have since significantly modified the game.
