# Flappy-Bird
A Web App that will first reverse engineer Flappy Bird then add in my own features and skins to ultimately port this app to all popular mobile platforms using Apache Cordova soon

The work in progress can be viewed at http://kanac.github.io/Flappy-Bird/

The original project that was used as a scaffold for this project can be found at http://www.lessmilk.com/flappy_bird/01/ and I have since significantly modified the game.
